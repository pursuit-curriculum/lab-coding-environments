# Coding Environments Lab

## Introduction

Build a small server that is configured to use dotenv. This application will be the base application for the next couple of labs.

## Getting started

- Fork this repo
- `git clone` the forked repository

## Part 1

### Build a basic Express server

Use the documentation and your notes to build a basic express server that has a welcome message at the root route. Be sure to separate the server listener functionality from the rest of the application and use dotenv to store environmental variables.

### Routes

Create the following routes:

- Root route that has a welcome message
- `/topten` route that has a list of top ten things of your choice
- `/topten/:index` route that lets you see one top ten item at a time

## Part 2

### Deploy the app to Heroku

## Part 3

### Set up unit testing
